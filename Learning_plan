Learning Strategy for Network Engineers
Week-by-week approach:

Weeks 1-2: Focus on understanding pointers and memory - this is the key difference from Python
Weeks 3-7: Build your packet manipulation toolkit - you'll use this constantly
Weeks 8-16: Learn high-performance techniques - this is where C shines over Python
Weeks 17-28: Apply to real network engineering problems

Performance Benchmarking:
Throughout your learning, compare your C implementations against your Python scripts:

Packet parsing speed (packets per second)
Memory usage
CPU utilization
Latency for packet processing

Practical Tips:

Start with capturing and parsing - this gives immediate feedback
Always run your code as root (or with CAP_NET_RAW) for raw socket access
Test with real network traffic captures
Use Wireshark to verify your packet crafting
Profile early and often - understand where bottlenecks are
Study open-source tools: tcpdump, libpcap, and Suricata source code

Expected Performance Gains:

Packet parsing: 100-1000x faster than Python
Packet generation: 10-100x higher PPS than Scapy
Memory usage: 5-10x less than Python equivalents
Latency: Microsecond vs millisecond processing times
